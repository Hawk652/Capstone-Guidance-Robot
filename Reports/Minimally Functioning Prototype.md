# Minimally Functioning Prototype

## Requirements

Dr. Van Neste requests for the autonomous robot (AuR) to have the ability to create a layout of the AuR's 
surrounding environment and store the mapped out environement. Using the map created, the AuR must be able to 
independently navigate from one point of interest to another with a simple command from the operator. The AuR must also avoid and 
prevent collision with an obstacle or the wall.
