# Minimally Functioning Prototype

## Locomotion
Enclosures for the new stepper motors were designed and printed. Unfortunately, the new stepper motors will not be utilized because the motor controllers will not be arriving in on time.

## Safety
The robot is able to prevent collision with an object or wall.

## Localization
ESP32 beacons were able to communicate with each other and relay positional data. The ESP32 beacons were used instead because the ultra-wideband beacons will not be arriving in on time. 

## Power and Charging
The chaging subsystem is able to transform AC power from a receptacle into DC power and deliver it to the robot's power system. The buck converters in subsystem is able to deliver 12 V at the output. However, the power subsystem will not have the desired battery due to ordering issues. 

## User Interface
The robot is able to move around and change directions with the use of voice commands through a microphone.

## Main Control
The robot is able to take commands from the user interface subsystem and use the LIDAR and motors to move around in its environment.
