# Lessons Learned
This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.

•	The things that went well were the meetings and negotiations that we had with our stakeholders, advisor and customer. We always came prepared and had all our ideas lined up and thoroughly researched beforehand. Apart from that, honestly not too much. Due to the supply chain issue, we were not able to get our hands on any of the parts that we had ordered for our project.
•	Not having access to our parts made it difficult to figure out a direction since our entire project was dependent on having our parts. We tried seeing what we could substitute, but to no avail. There wasn’t much of anything we could do or show that the turtlebot wasn’t already capable of achieving.
•	If put in the same position of having to figure out what upgrades to implement or not, I would be sure to choose upgrades that are going to be more accessible parts wise at the tradeoff of writing more code or spending extra time optimizing the system overall.
•	Documenting everything is something that I have learned from this exercise overall. Had it not been for paper trails, we would not have been able to negotiate any. 
•	To any students reading this: Be sure that you make communication the most important facet of the project. Without it, you will not be able to get anything done in any reasonable amount of time. On top of not getting things done, you will end up with a lot of inner conflicts that sprout up due to the lack of communication. Keeping everyone in the loop at every step of the way is the key to success because if anything comes up at the last minute, everyone will be ready and able to contribute.
•	I learned how to use plecs for more detailed circuit simulation, how to use LaTeX for more professional looking documentation, and the fundamentals of DC motor physics.
