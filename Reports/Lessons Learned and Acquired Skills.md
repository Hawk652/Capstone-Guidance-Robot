# Lessons Learned
This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.

•	The things that went well were the meetings and negotiations that we had with our stakeholders, advisor and customer. We always came prepared and had all our ideas lined up and thoroughly researched beforehand. Apart from that, honestly not too much. Due to the supply chain issue, we were not able to get our hands on any of the parts that we had ordered for our project.

•	Not having access to our parts made it difficult to figure out a direction since our entire project was dependent on having our parts. We tried seeing what we could substitute, but to no avail. There wasn’t much of anything we could do or show that the turtlebot wasn’t already capable of achieving.

•	If put in the same position of having to figure out what upgrades to implement or not, I would be sure to choose upgrades that are going to be more accessible parts wise at the tradeoff of writing more code or spending extra time optimizing the system overall.

•	Documenting everything is something that I have learned from this exercise overall. Had it not been for paper trails, we would not have been able to negotiate any. 

•	To any students reading this: Be sure that you make communication the most important facet of the project. Without it, you will not be able to get anything done in any reasonable amount of time. On top of not getting things done, you will end up with a lot of inner conflicts that sprout up due to the lack of communication. Keeping everyone in the loop at every step of the way is the key to success because if anything comes up at the last minute, everyone will be ready and able to contribute.

•	I learned how to use plecs for more detailed circuit simulation, how to use LaTeX for more professional looking documentation, and the fundamentals of DC motor physics.

-The things that went well were that we always had our weekly meetings and discussed what was happening in our project with our stakeholders and supervisor. At the beginning, the group really struggled with communication and making each other know that everyone's opinions are important.

-The biggest issue that we had was not recieving parts. Our project ended up not getting completed because of this hinderance.

- If I were to do it all again, I think that I would double check to make sure that eveything had been ordered and if not what could I do to get that done. I wish that we had more time to figure out how to improve our designs. If we had a class before this to prepare us for capstone, I believe that would help the transition stage from being studnet to engineer.

- Always have backup documentation, that way if anything were to happen you have evidence to prove what was said. Also, learn how to communicate with people, every person has a way they like to be communicated and just take that into consideration whether that be call, text, email and etc. In a professional setting, communication has been something that I have struggled with this semester and I think that I have improved significantly with this.

- Future students, my advice would be start everything extremely early. During the semester, all of the other classes will become busy and you will feel as though you are drowning in work. If you go ahead and make a schedule for yourself, you will feel more at ease during capstone. Learn the importance of communicating with your team, the most important thing is to talk to your team. This is not an individual project, it is a group project. However, when you begin your subsystems that can be viewed as your contribution to the team.

- I have learned how to design a circuit, design a PCB board and Surface Mount solder this semester. After completeing capstone, I feel very accomplished and proud of my contributions to the group. I have not only grown with my technical skills but also in my professional skills.
