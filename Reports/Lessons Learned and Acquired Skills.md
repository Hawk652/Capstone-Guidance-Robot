# Lessons Learned

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.
