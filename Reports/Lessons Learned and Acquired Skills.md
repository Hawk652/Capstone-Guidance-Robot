# Lessons Learned
This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.

### Reflections
Most of the designing and planning phase went well, but when it came to execution hardly anything went well. All of the problems were due to not getting the parts we needed to complete the project. In spite of all of this Dr. Van Neste was very helpful and understanding.
### Unanticipated Problems
The biggest unforeseen problem was not getting hardly any of the parts we needed to complete our project. I believe if we had gotten the needed supplies that we could have met most if not all of the specs and constraints.
### What I Would Redo
If I were to redo this project I would get the detail design phase done in the first semester so I could order the needed parts as soon as possible.
### Advice for Future Students
- Always have a backup plan
- Don't wait until last minute to do important things
- Understand that something will always go wrong
### Acquired Knowledge
- RSSI distancing is very inaccurate
- No amount of planning can make the impossible possible

•	The things that went well were the meetings and negotiations that we had with our stakeholders, advisor and customer. We always came prepared and had all our ideas lined up and thoroughly researched beforehand. Apart from that, honestly not too much. Due to the supply chain issue, we were not able to get our hands on any of the parts that we had ordered for our project.

•	Not having access to our parts made it difficult to figure out a direction since our entire project was dependent on having our parts. We tried seeing what we could substitute, but to no avail. There wasn’t much of anything we could do or show that the turtlebot wasn’t already capable of achieving.

•	If put in the same position of having to figure out what upgrades to implement or not, I would be sure to choose upgrades that are going to be more accessible parts wise at the tradeoff of writing more code or spending extra time optimizing the system overall.

•	Documenting everything is something that I have learned from this exercise overall. Had it not been for paper trails, we would not have been able to negotiate any. 

•	To any students reading this: Be sure that you make communication the most important facet of the project. Without it, you will not be able to get anything done in any reasonable amount of time. On top of not getting things done, you will end up with a lot of inner conflicts that sprout up due to the lack of communication. Keeping everyone in the loop at every step of the way is the key to success because if anything comes up at the last minute, everyone will be ready and able to contribute.

•	I learned how to use plecs for more detailed circuit simulation, how to use LaTeX for more professional looking documentation, and the fundamentals of DC motor physics.

The things that went well were that we always had our weekly meetings and discussed what was happening in our project with our stakeholders and supervisor. At the beginning, the group really struggled with communication and making each other know that everyone's opinions are important.

The biggest issue that we had was not recieving parts. Our project ended up not getting completed because of this hinderance.

If I were to do it all again, I think that I would double check to make sure that eveything had been ordered and if not what could I do to get that done. I wish that we had more time to figure out how to improve our designs. If we had a class before this to prepare us for capstone, I believe that would help the transition stage from being studnet to engineer.

Always have backup documentation, that way if anything were to happen you have evidence to prove what was said. Also, learn how to communicate with people, every person has a way they like to be communicated and just take that into consideration whether that be call, text, email and etc. In a professional setting, communication has been something that I have struggled with this semester and I think that I have improved significantly with this.

Future students, my advice would be start everything extremely early. During the semester, all of the other classes will become busy and you will feel as though you are drowning in work. If you go ahead and make a schedule for yourself, you will feel more at ease during capstone. Learn the importance of communicating with your team, the most important thing is to talk to your team. This is not an individual project, it is a group project. However, when you begin your subsystems that can be viewed as your contribution to the team.

I have learned how to design a circuit, design a PCB board and Surface Mount solder this semester. After completeing capstone, I feel very accomplished and proud of my contributions to the group. I have not only grown with my technical skills but also in my professional skills.

•    Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
  The team were able to complete tasks the sign offs within a reasonable time frame and collaborate well on tasks. What didn’t go well was some miscommunication between team members. Sometimes it was difficult to get in contact with team members at certain times. This made it difficult to complete some tasks.
  
•    What unanticipated problems occurred?
  Ordering was an issue I did not anticipate. The ordering issue made a major halt in the project’s progression during the second semester. I also did not anticipate how often team members would miss meetings due to different circumstances.
  
•    What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
  I would have all sign offs complete before the second semester so parts would arrive in a timely manner. I would also change some of the constraints and collaborate more with a mechanical team so the scope of the project would be more reasonable. 
  
•    What “best practices” have you identified?
  One “best practice” was me creating a weekly agenda for the team. This sometimes kept the team updated on deadlines and assisted in team members coordinating with their tasks.  Another good practice was trying to keep consistency  between everyone’s work. 
  
•    What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
  It is important to keep up with the deadlines and attempt to not fall behind. Another advice is to always make an attempt even though it seems something will fail.
  
•    What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.
  I increased my knowledge of simulating different circuits. Additionally, I learned how to 3d model and print.
  
## Jacob Wilkinson

Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
From an organizational point of view, collaboration was good within the different sections of the team, however overall group-wide communication was lacking. We had a group leader who bridged the gaps between the different subgroups, but that resulted in most of the communication going through him. From a technical point of view, the design of the subsystems went well. However, most of the parts never arrived, so very few non-software subsystems were able to be implemented.

•    What unanticipated problems occurred?
The major unanticipated problem we experienced was our components not arriving. Outside of that, we had a couple issues with differing communication from our advisor and the course instructor regarding expectations for the project.

•    What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
I would try to communicate more actively with my team. Most of the issues we encountered with the project were due to miscommunication between team members. I would also try to have more backup options available for when needed components don't arrive.

•    What “best practices” have you identified?
Weekly team meetings helped keep everyone on track, so they were a good practice to have. It's also good practice to document what you work on and let your other team members look over it.

•    What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
Communicate! Let your team members know what issues you're having and there will often be someone who can help! Also, for the sake of you and your team members' sanity, try to finish your part at least a couple days before the deadline instead of rushing to complete it at the last minute.

•    What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.
I worked mostly with the software of the AuR, so the main technical skills I learned were using and interfacing with ROS and the other software we used. From a soft skills standpoint, I learned better how to communicate and work with a team.
