# Lessons Learned

This document should be used as an ongoing documentation of the following:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Create a section addressing each of the above questions.
