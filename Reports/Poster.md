## Poster size expectations

The poster should be 42 by 24. 

## Power point instructions

The college of engineering has poster templates available via the library website. However, the posters are not sized appropriately for the departments expectations. Be sure to resize the poster in power point in the following manner.

1. Choose “DESIGN”
2. Choose “Slide Size”
3. Choose “Custom Slide Size”
4. Choose “Widescreen”
5. Width: 42”
6. Height: 24”
7. Slide Orientation: “Landscape”
8. Design your poster
9. Save your slide as a PDF (within PowerPoint)

## Overleaf/Latex instructions

You may instead choose to use overleaf to make the poster. A template is included [here](https://github.com/TnTech-ECE/CapstoneStarterRepo/tree/main/Reports/Poster%20Template). Upload this template to overleaf and customize as necessary. The template is already the appropriate size.
