# Analysis of the Locomotion Subsystem

## Locomotion Subsystem
The constraints below will not be achievable due to not receiving motor controllers to drive the motors:
 - Shall travel at a speed of 0.7 m/s Â± 0.1 m/s

### Experimental Methods
We ran an experiment of 5 trials to determine the top speed of the AuR. In these experiments, we marked a distance of 2 meters, accelerated the AuR to its top speed, then measured the time between crossing the two marked positions. This gave an overall average top speed of 0.23 m/s, which is within the expected range.

### Results

| Distance | Time |
|----------|------|
| 2m       | 8.52s|
| 2m       | 8.75s|
| 2m       | 8.68s|
| 2m       | 8.56s|
| 2m       | 8.53s|
