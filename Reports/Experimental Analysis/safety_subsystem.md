# Analysis of the Safety Subsystem

## Safety Subsystem
The constraints below will not be achievable due to not having the battery:
 - Shall have manual override (power will be cut from the motor)
 The constraint below will be met because of the implementation of Lidar:
 - Shall maintain a distance of 0.5 m from obstacles and people
 
## LIDAR
- We were able to get the robot to stop by utilizing the LIDAR. When the robot comes into contact with an object or person, it is programmed to stop.

## Proximity Sensor
- Was unable to test coils due to test due to delivery issues
- Printed out 3d models for bobbins for the coils
- If I were able to test this I would have tested the reasonance frequency and made sure that all of my turn were consistent. 

## Ultrasonic Sensor
- Was unable to test anything because these parts have not arrived 
- If I were to test this I would have tested the distance by placing an object in front of it, and seeing how long it would have taken for the information to be received. I would perform this task several times to ensure that the data was accurate.
