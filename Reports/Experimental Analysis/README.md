#Experimental Analysis

The files in this folder are broken down by subsystem and provide insight as to why major components/design elements were selected. Alot of our design choices 
were based upon meeting specifications/constraints as well as keeping costs down overall wherever possible for the final product. The docmuentation for each subsystem 
not only explains what choices were made in the design phase, but also whether or not the implementation was successful or not and why or why not.
