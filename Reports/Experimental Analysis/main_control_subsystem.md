# Analysis of the Main Control Subsystem

## Main Control Subsystem
The constraint that will be tested is:
- Shall operate on one level

## Testing Method
In order to test proper operation, we first need to verify that the AuR can take data from the Lidar and use the data to form a map of a floor. The AuR must be able to navigate within the map without falling down or going up stairs. The testing location is floor 4 of Prescott hall.

## Results
We were able to map the fourth floor of Prescott Hall and have the robot move around to various points while avoiding the stairwell. This verifies that the constraint is met.
