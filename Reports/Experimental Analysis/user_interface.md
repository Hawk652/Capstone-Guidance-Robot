 - Shall provide functional voice assistant interface 
 
### Testing Method
The user interface shall be tested by speaking commands and determining whether the AuR produces the appropriate response

After testing the "go to" command, the AuR correctly navigated to the given destination:
- Tested "go to room 119", AuR navigated to Prescott room 119
- Tested "go to elevator", AuR navigated to the elevator we set
- Tested "go to home", AuR navigated to the point we marked as its home
