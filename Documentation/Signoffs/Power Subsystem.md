# Power Subsystem

## Function of the Subsystem
The function of the power subsystem is to recieve power from the docking station subsystem and distribute the power to the other subsytems. The power subsystem also has a battery monitoring system that will notify the main control subsystem when the battery charge below a certain threshold. 

## Specifications and Constraints

| No. | Specifications and Constraints | Origin | 
|-|-|-| 
| 1 | Shall have plugless charging | Supervisor: Dr. Van Neste 
| 2 | Shall have a ripple voltage tolerance of 50 mVpp | Supervisor: Dr. Van Neste
| 3 | Shall follow proper wire gauging standards | NEC 310.16(b)
| 4 | Shall not operate below 15-20% of the battery capacity | Ethics

## Buildable Schematic 
![ALT](https://github.com/Hawk652/Capstone-Guidance-Robot/blob/main/Documentation/Images/power%20circuit%20schematic.png)
The circuit schematic is currently incomplete due to unknown loads at the time. A pcb schematic will potentially be added to in the future. Furthermore, 3d cad schematics will potentially be added to house components.

## Analysis
Analysis of the subsystem is incomplete due to unknown loads added on. Analysis will be done in the future.
