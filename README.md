# Greeting and Guidance Robot


## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.

## Capabilities

The current version of the project serves as an oversized paperweight at the moment. 

## Salient Outcomes

We learned that bluetooth 5.2 location services is not very accesible at the consumer level as of yet outside of heavy research or recent products. It's the reason why we ended up having to change to ultra wideband triangulation for location verification. We're also going to be learning about and implementing near field sensors as close range location verification with the assistance of Dr. Charles Van Neste More stuff will get added as we actually assemble the project.

## Project Demonstration & Images

Nothing here yet but check back in a bit!
