# Error Calculations for Trilateration
## Function
This script runs a random amount of points in a range and calculates the error of the robot at that location. This assumes a specific placement of beacons and requires that the max error for each beacon is 10cm. The error is calculated for many points and the max error for all tested points is shown. This should prove the accuracy of the system.
